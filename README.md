## Thesis:
There is a major global crisis regarding energy accessibility, with nearly a tenth of the population not having easily accessible electricity for basic survival purposes. With the heavy use of fossil fuels and renewable sources for electricity production, nuclear energy plants have gone severly undervalued despite its extensive contribution to the world's electricity supply, especially by the countries in need. We encourage the representatives of those countries to evaluate the vast benefits that nuclear energy has to offer and promote creating a more sustainable future!

## Context:
**Who**: Representatives that are in search of a more efficient energy source for their country.

**What**: Energy production through nuclear sources have proven to be more environmentally friendly and sustainable compared to fossil fuels and renewable sources; please consider opting into nuclear power plants for energy production.

**How**: Illustrate the absence of nuclear sources in energy production by contrasting it to the dominance of fossil fuels and renewable sources in the energy production market.

## Strategies Used: 
* Employed white space in both my Plotly dash and presentation. 
* Margins remain free of text and visuals. 
* Visuals are not stretched to take up the available space; instead, appropriately sized to my content. 	
* The only thing on the page; a single sentence or even a single number. 
* All text in the visual is the same size except where decisions were made to further emphasize or de‚Äêemphasize components. 
* The graph title is larger.
* Implemented a callback function that could compare 2 maps at once.
* Intentionally chose map colors to be white-light blue in order to show less disparity for visualization.
